		<h1>Magic Squares</h1>
		<p>A magic square is a square of n*n where n is the count of numbers in a row or column. All the numbers are distinct positive integers starting at 1. The numbers are organized such that each row, column, and the two main diagonals sum to the same number. The sum is called the magic constant. A square is said to have an order of n. </p>
		
		<ul class="three clear">
		  <li>2</li>
		  <li>7</li>
		  <li>6</li>
		  
		  <li>9</li>
		  <li>5</li>
		  <li>1</li>
		  
		  <li>4</li>
		  <li>3</li>
		  <li>8</li>
		</ul>
		
<p>Magic Squares can be attempted at any order. However, it should be noted that the solution of a magic square at order 1 is trivial. There is a single solution of one number inside a single square. Also, at an order of 2 there are no solutions. With the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 we can see this in practice. There is no way for any number you pick to be added to two other numbers for the same result(1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 4 = 5). Therefore it is unsolvable. </p>

<p>Solutions to a magic square are considered unique if they cannot be rotated or reflected to create another solution. This of course means that each solution has 8 semi-distinct squares. These 8 squares are considered equivalent and make up an Equivalence Class. </p>

<p>From this we can start to talk about distinct solutions. For a square of order 3 there is one distinct solution. For a square of order 4 there are 880 distinct solutions. For a square of order 5 there are over 200k solutions.  </p>

<p>The magic constant can be determined based on the square size. For a normal square(starting at 1) the equation is n(n^2 + 1)/2. This is based on an optimization of a brute force solution. Each section should equal the magic sum divided by the order of the square. The magic sum is the total of all of the numbers in the square. For our 3*3 square thats 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.   So the magic constant is that divided by the number of rows or columns or 15. This is because we need to use all the numbers in tat number of sections. This is optimized with a calculation of the total of a series of numbers from 1 to a number let's say x. x * (x + 1) / 2. For example, 9 * (9 + 1) / 2 or 9 * 10 / 2 or 90 / 2 or 45. This works because for a sequence of numbers starting at 1 the number one less than a number plus one will equal that number, one below that plus 2 will equal the number etc. This occurs x / 2 times. For 9 it occurs up to 4 which matches 5 and stops it. So it happens 4 times. We actually have the number 1 additional time for the actual number, but when we count we are counting the numbers that add together to make the number. We add one to the count of numbers to make up for this, think of it as a 0 that we are adding to the max number to create a pair. Then we can calculate the number of pairs by dividing the max number plus our imaginary number by 2 which gives us (x + 1) / 2. For an even number is won't fully complete. For example, for 4 we have 4, 1 + 3, and 2. So the total of all the numbers will be the number times </p>
